# Android TextureView OpenGL ES 2.0 Example
It's a very simple example of using OpenGL ES 2.0 on Android platform. It uses TextureView for good integration with 
system. The example written in Kotlin and contains about 70 lines of code (with context creation, etc). So it's very 
simple sample for introducing in OpenGL in Android.

It has been tested with and without "Don't keep activities" mode on Nexus 5.  

Have fun! :-)
